# AnimatedQRCodeReader

**Update:** There is a new cross-platform Ionic version which supports two-way communication: <https://github.com/tony-xlh/QRTransfer/>

Animated QR code reader. The repo contains the generator as well.

Using the generator and reader, it is possible to transfer data between two devices without an Internet connection.

The generator and reader are implemented in JavaScript using the [QR code generator](https://github.com/kazuhikoarase/qrcode-generator/) and the [Dynamsoft Barcode Reader](https://www.dynamsoft.com/barcode-reader/overview/).

An Andoird project using [Dynamsoft Camera Enhancer](https://www.dynamsoft.com/camera-enhancer/docs/introduction/) and Dynamsoft Barcode Reader is included as well.
